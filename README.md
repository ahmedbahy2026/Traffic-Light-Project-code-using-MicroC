# Traffic-Light-Project-code-using-MicroC

The Traffic Light Project using MicroC is an embedded system project that simulates a smart traffic light control system. The project is designed to efficiently manage traffic flow at intersections by controlling the timing of the traffic lights. The code is implemented in MicroC, a high-level programming language specifically designed for microcontrollers, making it easy to write and understand.

Project Objective:
The main objective of the project is to create a traffic light control system that optimizes traffic flow, reduces congestion, and improves road safety by synchronizing the traffic light phases for different directions.

Microcontroller and Hardware:
The project uses a microcontroller, such as the PIC16F877A, which is programmed using MicroC. Additional hardware components required for the project include LEDs for the traffic lights (Red, Yellow, and Green), current-limiting resistors, and a power supply.
